# Mapbox example using play/pause button
Sample extracted from https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/timeline-animation/ and added play functionality for the slider.

## Mapbox Token
It is necessary to have a mapbox access token. For obvious reasons the token is not stored in the repo. The way to add your token is to create a `mapbox-token-setup.js` file with the following content.
```javascript
const myToken = 'YOUR_TOKEN'
```
